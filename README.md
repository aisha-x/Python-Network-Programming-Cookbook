# Python Network Programming Cookbook Second Edition 

# About this repository
-------------------------------------------
This repository contains scripts I have learned and practiced from this book => [Python Network Programming CookBook](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/python-network-programming-cookbook-9781786463999) by Pradeeban Kathiravelu, and Dr. M. O. Faruque Sarker


# Modifications
----------------------------------------------
the original examples from the book serve as a foundation, and any changes I made are for educational and personal practice purposes.




#About this Book:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This book is an exploratory guide to network programming in Python. It has touched a
 wide range of networking protocols such as TCP/UDP, HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, POP3,
 IMAP, and CGI. With the power and interactivity of Python, it brings joy and fun to
 develop various scripts for performing real-world tasks on network and system
 administration, web application development, interacting with your local and remote
 network, low-level network packet capture and analysis, and so on. The primary focus of
 this book is to give you a hands-on experience on the topics covered. So, this book covers
 less theory, but it is packed with practical materials.

# What you need for this book:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

 You need a working PC or laptop, preferably with a modern Linux operating system. The
 installation instructions are written and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and would work on
 any recent Debian-based Linux operating system without modification. We developed for
 Python 3. However, we have maintained backward-compatibility with Python 2 in our
 recipes as much as we can. On the other hand, some open source projects used in this book
 do not yet support Python 3. So, ideally, you will need both Python 2 and Python 3 to test
 all the recipes in this book.
 Most of the recipes in this book will run on other platforms such as Windows and Mac OS
 with some changes in the configuration steps. Some of the recipes require two or more
 computers in a cluster to test the distributed systems. You may use Amazon Web Services
 (AWS) to initiate a cluster inside a single placement group to test these recipes.
 You also need a working internet connection to install the third-party software libraries
 mentioned with respective recipes. If you do not have a stable or continuous internet
 connection, you can download the third-party libraries and install them in one go.
 However, it is highly recommended to test some of these recipes with the internet
 connection, as it would make the configuration task minimal and more interesting, than
 having to download a bulk of software in bunch. Moreover, testing the application in an
 AWS cluster would certainly require the internet connectivity.
 



# Who this book is for
----------------------------------------------------------------
 If you are a network programmer, system/network administrator, or a web application
 developer, this book is ideal for you. You should have a basic familiarity with the Python
 programming language and TCP/IP networking concepts. However, if you are a novice,
 you will develop an understanding of the concepts as you progress with this book. This
 book will serve as supplementary material for developing hands-on skills in any academic
 course on network programming.
